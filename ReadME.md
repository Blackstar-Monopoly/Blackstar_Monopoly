# Blackstar Monopoly
The codebase for Blackstar Monopoly Game

Monopoly is a game about money, it is the world's textbook, written by a communist - because no one knows you better than your enemy. - [Wikipedia/History_of_Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Monopoly)
```
The board game Monopoly has its origin in the early 20th century. The earliest known version, known as The Landlord's Game, was designed by Elizabeth Magie and first patented in 1904, but existed as early as 1902.

```
As such, it is the best means through which to learn how to manage money, and create wealth.

My goals:
```
1. Create a fun game and a learning medium accessible to everyone
2. Create a community of like-minded people, with the vision to build a wealthy future
3. Create clubs and organisations of people to act as a force for good, providing a media for conversation and ideas
```

## Structure
### Gameplay
Like [Monopoly](https://monopoly.hasbro.com/en-us/digital) and [Cashflow Classic](https://www.richdad.com/classic), Blackstar Monopoly is a game about money management and wealth creation - getting free of the rat race.

The guidelines are simple: buy land, build houses, take loans, invest, become the bank.

Detailed rules can be defined in [rules](https://github.com/Blackstar-Monopoly/Blackstar_Monopoly/blob/main/Rules.md).

The best strategy, is to use Fate, Time, and Door, to create successful game runs.
Promises:
1. Disasters will happen
2. Losses will come
3. The winner doesn't just survive, but turns failure into success

Success isn't when you win once, it's when you win more often than you lose: but lose you must in the eyes of Fate.
```
    Enjoy life with your beloved wife all the days of 
    the fleeting life that God has given you 
    under the sun
    —all your fleeting days. 
    For this is your portion in life 
    and in your labor under the sun. 
    Whatever you find to do with your hands, 
    do it with all your might, for in Sheol, 
    where you are going, there is no work or planning 
    or knowledge or wisdom.
    
    I saw something else under the sun: 
    The race is not to the swift, 
    nor the battle to the strong; 
    neither is the bread to the wise, 
    nor the wealth to the intelligent, 
    nor the favor to the skillful. 
    For time and chance happen to all. 
    For surely no man knows his time: 
    Like fish caught in a cruel net 
    or birds trapped in a snare, 
    so men are ensnared in an evil time 
    that suddenly falls upon them. 
                - Ecclesiastes 9:9-12
```
Motto:
> *Hand of **Fate**, Chance in **Time**, Door of **Opportunity***.

### LAN Clubs 
Blackstar Monopoly is a social game, the idea is: money is a social contract, therefore having a society is key for money to make sense.
> Money is a social contract

Therefore the game is designed to be multiplayer from the ground up, there is no Artificial Intelligence to play the game against: get friends.

Mobile and Desktop versions include a LAN server to play with friends (without need for an online connection - if unavailable).

The game also  includes a history log, to allow replays and repeat plays, as well as extended games (same game but played over several days/sessions).

Blackstar Monopoly can be played solo, 
Blackstar Monopoly includes an api for players to create bots and/or clients for other platforms. 
Blackstar Monopoly server allows players across the planet to play games with each other, 
or for clubs across the planet to play with/against each other.
```
    Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun:
    There is one alone, without companion:
    He has neither son nor brother.
    Yet there is no end to all his labors,
    Nor is his eye satisfied with riches.
    But he never asks,
    “For whom do I toil and deprive myself of good?”

    This also is vanity and a grave misfortune:
    Two are better than one,
    Because they have a good reward for their labor. 
    For if they fall, 
    one will lift up his companion.
    But woe to him who is alone when he falls,
    For he has no one to help him up.
    Again, 
    if two lie down together, 
    they will keep warm;
    But how can one be warm alone?
    Though one may be overpowered by another, 
    two can withstand him.

    And a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
            - Ecclesiastes 4:7-12

### Online
The game is a social game, the biggest society is the world-wide human family.

Blackstar Monopoly Online is a Solana Blockchain App.
For several reasons:
- Blackstar Monopoly accounts will be a real wallet,
- Blackstar Monopoly tokens will be a real token,
- Smart contract debts,
- Blackstar Monopoly accounts will act as OAuth,
- Circumvent various/all forms of censorship and control

```
    For the word of a king is 
    authoritative and powerful,
    And who will say to him,
    “What are you doing?”
    Whoever keeps and observes a royal command 
    will experience neither trouble nor misery;
    For a wise heart will know the 
    proper time and [appropriate] procedure.
    For there is a proper time and 
    [appropriate] procedure for every delight,
    Though mankind’s misery and 
    trouble lies heavily upon him 
    [who rebels against the king].
    For no one knows what will happen;
    So who can tell him how 
    and when it will happen?

    There is no man who has power 
    and authority over the wind 
    to restrain the wind,
    Nor does he have authority 
    over the day of death;
    There is no discharge [from service] 
    during time of war,
    And evil will not rescue those who 
    [actively seek to] practice it. 
    All this I have seen while applying my mind 
    to every deed that is done under the sun. 
    There is a time in which one man 
    has exercised power over others to their detriment. 
            - Ecclesiastes 8:4-9
