# Blackstar Monopoly
The codebase for Blackstar Monopoly Game

Monopoly is a game about money, it is the world's textbook, written by a communist - because no one knows you better than your enemy. - [Wikipedia/History_of_Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Monopoly)
```
The board game Monopoly has its origin in the early 20th century. The earliest known version, known as The Landlord's Game, was designed by Elizabeth Magie and first patented in 1904, but existed as early as 1902.

As such, it is the best means through which to learn how to manage money, and create wealth.

My goals:
```
1. Create a fun game and a learning medium accessible to everyone
2. Create a community of like-minded people, with the vision to build a wealthy future
3. Create clubs and organisations of people to act as a force for good, providing a media for conversation and ideas
```

## Structure
### Gameplay
Like [Monopoly](https://monopoly.hasbro.com/en-us/digital) and [Cashflow Classic](https://www.richdad.com/classic), Blackstar Monopoly is a game about money management and wealth creation - getting free of the rat race.

The guidelines are simple: buy land, build houses, take loans, invest, become the bank.

Detailed rules can be defined in [rules](https://github.com/Blackstar-Monopoly/Blackstar_Monopoly/blob/main/Rules.md).

The best strategy, is to use Fate, Time, and Door, to create successful game runs.
Promises:
1. Disasters will happen
2. Losses will come
3. The winner doesn't just survive, but turns failure into success

Success isn't when you win once, it's when you win more often than you lose: but lose you must in the eyes of Fate.
```
    Enjoy life with your beloved wife all the days of the fleetingb life that God has given you under the sunâ€”all your fleeting days. For this is your portion in life and in your labor under the sun. 
    Whatever you find to do with your hands, do it with all your might, for in Sheol, where you are going, there is no work or planning or knowledge or wisdom.
    I saw something else under the sun: The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong; neither is the bread to the wise, nor the wealth to the intelligent, nor the favor to the skillful. For time and chance happen to all. 
    For surely no man knows his time: Like fish caught in a cruel net or birds trapped in a snare, so men are ensnared in an evil time that suddenly falls upon them. 
                - Ecclesiastes 9:9-12
