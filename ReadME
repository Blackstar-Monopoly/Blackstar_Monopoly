The codebase for Blackstar Monopoly Game

Monopoly is a game about money, it is the world's textbook, written by a communist - because no one knows you better than your enemy. - [Wikipedia/History_of_Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Monopoly)

The board game Monopoly has its origin in the early 20th century. The earliest known version, known as The Landlord's Game, was designed by Elizabeth Magie and first patented in 1904, but existed as early as 1902.

As such, it is the best means through which to learn how to manage money, and create wealth.

My goals:
```
1. Create a fun game and a learning medium accessible to everyone
2. Create a community of like-minded people, with the vision to build a wealthy future
3. Create clubs and organisations of people to act as a force for good, providing a media for conversation and ideas
